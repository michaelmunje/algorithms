General

  1. Find the most frequent integer in an array

  2. Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)

  3. Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A=   {1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}

  4. Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)

  5. Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.

  6. Find the common elements of 2 int arrays

  7. Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers

  8. Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})

  9. Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers

  10. Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int

  11. Implement parseInt

  12. Implement squareroot function

  13. Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)

  14. Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *

  15. HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()

  16. HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)
